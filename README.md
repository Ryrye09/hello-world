Just another repository


Hello there, my name is Ryan Wells. I have a b.s. in electrical engineering. During my time in school I had classes on programming but was never good at it. As I am going through the job market it seems theres a lot of jobs that require some sort of programming so I am just trying to learn programming so i dont sound like an idiot in job interviews.
